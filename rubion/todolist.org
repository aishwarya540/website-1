* Important[0/2][0%]
- [ ] Allow admins to receive the errors if something is not working! 
- [ ] Sometimes (I don't know when exactly), a IOError is thrown. This is
  quite weird and must(!) be fixed before going live.
- 

* Translation [2/3][66%]
- [ ] Menu-Template -> title_trans (ggf. definieren in website.models)
- [X] Add `role` field in german to Staff page
- [X] Make children of a list use `title_trans` instead of title. Required by
  the new translation design. [redefined get_admin_display_title]
- 

* Anderes [5/10][50%]
- [X] slug für Startseite in Admin einblenden
- [ ] Admin-Login should not redirect to /accounts (just a setting in base.py) 
- [ ] `About us`
  - [ ] If implemented as a single page, the /Staff/ section will be hidden
    under this page in the admin menu. If not implemented as a page, the
    breadcrump (RUB->RUBION->etc) will not reflect the menu structure. I chose
    this solution for now, but it's worth to be discussed. 
  - [ ] What should be listed here?
- [-] Rethink the ordering of `get_children` in `AbstractContainerPage`. Order
  by `title_trans` does not work, since it is passed to the database. [1/3][33%]
  - [X] Apply the workaround from production to dev.
  - [ ] Use laguage dependend search order
  - [ ] *Important* `get_children` is used by the admin interface. Use another
    name to allow editing non-live pages.
- [ ] Replace `ruhr-uni-bochum.de` in email addresses from the LDAP server by
  `rub.de`
- [ ] Make staff list use given order, not alphabetic.
- [X] News should use different editor for richtext
- [X] News: add a meaningful __str__ method.
- [X] News: Reihenfolge auf Startseite ändern.
- [X] Methods/Instruments: Allow header image
